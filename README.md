https://github.com/comeon-group/comeon-javascript-test - Assignment Problem.

The project is based on `Next - 13`.

## Getting Started

Steps to be followed to initialize the project:

1. Open terminal with path `comeon_assignment` and run `npm install` and `npm install -g json-server`.
2. On successful installation, run command `npm run dev`.
3. Open new terminal, navigate to `\comeon_assignment\my-assignmeent\app` to run json server using command `json-server --watch mock/mock-data.json --port 3001 --middlewares mock/mock-api.js`.
4. I have used packages like `React Toastify` (to display message to user), `Sass`(for styling), `cookies` (to store session) of the user.
5. There are two pages in this project namely `GameList` and `GamePage`. I have used modal for login scenarios (for better performance). 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
